# Aftership API

*Re-write of the official aftership api nuget package in .Net core 2.2*

The official [aftership](https://www.aftership.com) api is written using .net framework, as Microsoft is moving away from framework and is improving support for cross-platform deployment for C# Projects,
this package has been written to use the latest stable version of .net core which at this time is 2.2.
